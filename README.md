# poolfileupload

This uploader assists in uploading Pool Files. 
* Pool Files are TSV files with 12 columns. 
* The headers are, in order from left to right: "barcode", "rcbarcode",
"nTot", "n", "scaffold", "strand", "pos", "n2", "scaffold2", "strand2", "pos2",
"nPastEnd".
* The pool file is part of the RBTnSeq (Random Barcode Transposon Sequencing)
analysis program. 
* The app "MapTnSeq" also outputs a pool file. 
* The pool file is used as a reference to find the important reads after 
running transposon sequencing. 
* A pool file is used as an input to the app "RBTnSeq Reads to Pool Counts".
* The biological goal of the programs is to quantify the abundance of each 
barcoded strain in each sample.
* For more information, consider the following article:

Sequencing Randomly Bar-Coded Transposons" - Kelly M. Wetmore, Morgan N. Price,
